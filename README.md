# Alien Invasion

This is a Python project that I worked a little on during my introduction to python class in college.  I went back and finished out the project as practice.

This project has helped me brush up on the basics of python while making it all fit together into a cool 2D game!



## Installation



```bash
  # Clone the repo
  git clone https://github.com/Mitchell-jpg/Alien-Invasion.git

  # Change the directory to Alien-Invasion
  cd Alien-Invasion

  # Start the game
  python3 alien_invasion.py
```
